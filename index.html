	<h3> <strong>Game Title: Hades</strong></h3>
	<h4> Description: </h4>
	<p> <strong>Hades</strong> is a roguelike action dungeon crawler game based on the Greek interpretation of Hell. Players play as the son of Hades, Zagreus, in an attempt to escape the dungeons of hell and reach the surface. The game is structured into 4 floors, with each having unique gimmicks and bosses, as well as a final boss fight. If a player is able to defeat the final boss without running out of lives, they will reach the surface and beat the game. Hades is unique in that it has permanent upgrades and progress, as well as an overlapping story through each escape attempt, and many different weapon options and difficulty settings a player can use for a revamped experience between each attempt.</p>

	<h4> Review:</h4>
		<p>I personally played Hades on my computer, and it is a game I enjoyed very much. I think it's very unique compared to other games in its genre, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Greek Mythology, Roguelike games, or gaming in general. The characters are all interesting and the story is much more fleshed out than I would have expected of a game from the roguelike genre. On top of that the music for the game is excellent, and there are so many customizable options for each escape attempt that the game never feels repetitive or boring. I thoroughly enjoy this game and would recommend it to anyone, especially considering its lower requirements computer-wise, and its lower pricing compared to most video games.</p>
